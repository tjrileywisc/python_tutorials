##Python day 2 - printing things to the interpreter
 
Python should now start from the command line (type 'python' and hit enter) or from the start menu search. If not, go back to day 1.
 
 
#Your first program:
 
This will be super easy - you're going to ask the python interpreter to spit some text back out at you. Type (don't copy paste, you need to build up some muscle memory to code faster!) the following into the window (after the >>> prompt):
 
 
```print "hello world"```

 
Now press enter. You should see this printed to your screen in the console window:
 
 
 
 
If it worked, great! You have made a simple 'program' now that does a very silly thing but you have seen a bit of the python syntax already. Try this now:


```print 'hello world'```

 
Did that work? It better have - single quotes (') are equivalent to double quotes (") in python.
 
What you've done here is created a string (as in, a string of characters). Anything surrounded by ' or " is a string. But please note- if you start with ', you need to end with ' again (likewise with ").
 
Now a little more:


```print 12345```


You should see this:
 
 
 
 
```12345``` here is a not a string, it is an integer type, but you can still print it.
 
If you have experience with C or Java, you might note that we didn't write ```int``` or ```String``` or ```char``` anywhere above. Python figures out the variable type for us.
 
You're likely to use ```print``` a lot, especially when printing out logging data or in debugging.
