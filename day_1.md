##Python Day 1 - just getting set up!
 
#Installing python
 
1. Go to the start menu
2. Type 'python' (without quotes) and hit enter
3. Do you see a window like this? Does the version number show 2.7.x (left arrow)? And is it 64-bit? If so, you're done for today, congrats!

If not, you have some work ahead of you. 
1. Go to this page.
2. Download the Python installer msi (64-bit) for python 2.7.x (see comment below about 3.x versions).
3. Double click on the .msi and install - while running, choose the option to add Python to your path environment variable. 
This gives Windows a reference to the installation location for python, so that when you type 'python' into the start 
menu (or a cmd window), a python interpreter should start up.

#About python 3.x:

You might see links to install python 3.x. This has been out for a while now but python 2.7.x is probably still more widely used at the time of writing of this tutorial and it is assumed you will be running this version. After going through these tutorials, you can migrate to that version if it fits your needs.
