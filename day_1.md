Python Day 1 - just getting set up!
 
Installing python
 
1. Go to the start menu
2. Type python and hit enter
3. Do you see a window like this? Does the version number show 2.7.x (left arrow)? And is it 64-bit? If so, you're done for today, congrats!
 
 
 
 
If not, you have some work ahead of you. 
1. Go to this page.
2. Download the Python installer msi (64-bit).
3. Double click on the .msi and install - while running, choose the option to add Python to your path environment variable. 
This gives Windows a reference to the installation location for python, so that when you type 'python' into the start 
menu (or a cmd window), a python interpreter should start up.
